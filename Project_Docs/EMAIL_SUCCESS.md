# ✅ EMAIL SYSTEM IS WORKING!

## 🎉 **SUCCESS!**

Your test showed:
- ✅ All 4 emails sent successfully!
- ✅ Status: 200 (Success)
- ✅ EmailJS configuration is correct
- ✅ All receivers got emails

---

## 🔧 **What I Fixed:**

### **1. Changed "Receiver #3" to Email Username**
- **Before:** "Hello Receiver #3,"
- **After:** "Hello harishpranavs259," (uses email username)

### **2. Fixed Both Files:**
- ✅ `email-sender.js` - Updated
- ✅ `test-email.html` - Updated

---

## 🧪 **NOW TEST:**

### **Step 1: Test the Updated Test Page**
1. Refresh `test-email.html` (Ctrl + F5)
2. Click "Send Test Email"
3. Check emails - should now say email username instead of "Receiver #3"

### **Step 2: Test Main Website**
1. **Open:** `index.html` in your browser
2. **Press:** Ctrl + F5 (hard refresh to clear cache)
3. **Click:** Settings icon (⚙️)
4. **Scroll down** to "Email Notifications" section
5. **Click:** "Send Test Email" button
6. **Wait:** 2-3 seconds
7. **Check:** Success message should appear
8. **Open:** Browser console (F12) to see logs
9. **Check:** All 4 email inboxes

---

## ⚠️ **If Main Site Still Doesn't Work:**

Open browser console (F12) and look for:

**Error Type 1: "sendTestEmail is not defined"**
- Solution: Hard refresh (Ctrl + Shift + R)

**Error Type 2: "EMAIL_CONFIG is not defined"**
- Solution: Check that email-config.js is loading

**Error Type 3: No error, just not sending**
- Solution: Make sure you're viewing from the same folder
